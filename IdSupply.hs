{-# LANGUAGE MagicHash #-}

-- | This module provides splittable supplies for unique identifiers.
--   The main idea gows back to L. Augustsson, M. Rittri, and D. Synek
--   and is described in their paper 'On generating unique names'
--   (Journal of Functional Programming 4(1), 1994. pp. 117-123). The
--   implementation at hand is taken from the GHC sources and includes
--   bit fiddling to allow multiple supplies that generate unique
--   identifiers by prepending a character given at initialization.
--
--   This is a custom version of uniqueid-0.1.1 to resolve some bugs I
--   found in it.
